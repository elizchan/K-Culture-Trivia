# K-Culture-Trivia
Intro to Trivia Setup
-There are 2 players and 100 questions about Korean culture
-In order to play against each other in real time there is a random code generator
-Each question lasts 20 seconds
-The score would be tallied at the end, whoever answers the most questions correctly wins the game

Approach Taken to Create the Game
-I thought of 100 different questions about K-Pop, K-dramas, K-food and K-Geography
