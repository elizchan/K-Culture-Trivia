# K-Culture-Trivia
Intro to Trivia Setup
-There are 2 players and 100 questions about Korean culture
-In order to play against each other in real time there is a random code generator
-Each question lasts 20 seconds
-The score would be tallied at the end, whoever answers the most questions correctly wins the game

Approach Taken to Create the Game
-I thought of 100 different questions about K-Pop, K-dramas, K-food and K-Geography
-I created a div container to put the questions
-Created a function for a timer of 20 seconds for each question
-Created a function to generate a random 5 character code everytime for a new game
